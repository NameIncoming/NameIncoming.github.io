										<h3>Shaun Chow
</h3>
										<p>Technology is something that I have been interested in since a young age, so the decision to study Information Technology in RMIT University came naturally. Technology is constantly emerging over the years and fortunately, I am in the right era to be able to learn and observe how big of an impact it has on the world today. My interest started when I was in high school learning about how cloud services can affect the future workforce and even benefit companies that are venturing into technology.
Having previously worked as an admin assistant as well as a desktop support assistant has helped me become more comfortable with working in a team and strengthened my communication skills. With a positive attitude and a good work  ethic i believe i can spearhead any enterprise forward.
</p>
									
										
										<h3>Chuan Yeow</h3>
										<p>What sparked my interest was from learning how to host my own server on my own to play with my friends. I eventually learned through Server Development that there are modifications, such as Mods, Server Plugins, etc. And I was rightly interested in such an area, because it was what sparked me to learn Java and other programming languages. Eventually leading to Object-Oriented development quite early on.
I’ve experienced making multiple projects with proper industry-based managers, where they were in charge of real life projects. The goal was for one of them was to create a World War One memorial system that would inspire Year 9 kids to understand the history of their Country of Australia. My group developed it in a Google Maps system with markers around all addresses in Melbourne, where kids could search up their own houses and it would display Veterans who used to live in those addresses. The manager who gave us the pitch was very impressed and even gave the leader of my group project a part-time job in his own company.

										<h3>Fangjie Jin</h3>
										<p>My interest in information technology started with Video Chat. Video Chat is used to be an exciting topic in my childhood. At that time, texting and calling were the only two ways to communicate with someone who was far away from you. After Video Chat came out, everything went crazy.  I never thought that I could saw my friends on my computer before. The concept of transmission of video and sound impressed me a lot at that time.
Nowadays, Video Chat is just a simple function in mobile, but the concept of transmission of video and sound is not passed. I find that successful games have a Unique point that players can have an excellent visual and sound experience from the games.I like games, and I know a good game can make a lot of fun to players. So my passion is game developing.
However, my experience in IT is a bit poor. I only learned to create some simple HTML games like "Rock-paper-scissors." and "Tetris" by self-learning in youtube. I also learned some basic knowledge about the database and some game designing ideas. These knowledges are too simple that are not enough to create a good game. So I choose to come to RMIT. I want to get some practical skills and learn to use some game developer softwares like 3D unity and Photoshop.

									<h3>Dewmini Abeyaratne</h3>
										<p>My interest in IT is learning the different aspects of IT in general, however, my passion is Gaming Programming and Website Designing CMS and HTML. Because I did last year it was when I studied it was really enjoyable. I have always had an interest in IT because the world involves in IT, I also heard a lot of good thing about IT from other students who are doing course IT. I wanted to IT when I was in Year 9 as an elective and then I wanted to as subject and get into Uni and have a job within the IT industry.
I have worked with a real client where they wanted to build a mobile app I have learned the experience where your team members have problems where sometimes the people in the group are not helping the members. 
</p>
									<h3>Joanna Teppa</h3>
										<p>The spirit of wanting to learn about technology started when I was in secondary school where we learned how to manage and store data online. Learning about this makes me interested in database management, cloud computing and security. In addition, having lot of networks and computer issues back on my island got me into learning more about computer problems and how to solve them.</p>
									<h3>Corey Ross</h3>
									<p>The interest in IT started for me when i was very young, watching my dad build computers, but i only started learning more about it when I was in middle school, and it ramped up when i hit year 9 with making a flash animation for a project. My main interest of IT was when I touched unity and started coding and the possibility of making Games. </p>
									<h3>Mariam Farah</h3>
									<p>Upon having deep interests in other fields such as Law and sports, information technology never crossed my mind. My knowledge regarding the topic of information technology was close to little or nothing however oddly enough my interest was sparked through the television show ‘Scorpion’. The more I watched the show and perceived how a group of individuals tackled crime through IT, the more my interests regarding cyber-crime and programming cultivated. I did more intensive research in this field and found the way in which writing small code could produce a greater outcome such as a website, software or a communication platform. I realised that people underrated the power of this field as this very world were living in is working efficiently the way it is due to information technology. </p>
